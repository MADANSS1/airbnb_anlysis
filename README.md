# Airbnb Data Analysis 


## Introduction
Welcome to the Airbnb Data Analysis Project! This project aims to provide insights into Airbnb listings and hosts by analyzing data extracted from JSON files. Airbnb has revolutionized the hospitality industry by allowing individuals to rent out their properties or spare rooms to guests worldwide. Understanding the trends, pricing dynamics, host characteristics, and guest preferences can provide valuable insights for both hosts and travelers alike.
## Objective
1.Data Extraction: Process JSON data to extract relevant information such as listing details, host attributes, pricing, and review scores.

2.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize data, and prepare it for analysis.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze key metrics and trends in Airbnb listings and host characteristics.

4.Insights Generation: Extract actionable insights to understand factors influencing pricing, occupancy rates, and guest satisfaction.
## Usage
The project processes Airbnb JSON data files to create a structured DataFrame and perform data cleaning, normalization, and analysis. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies.
Place your Airbnb JSON data file (sample_airbnb.json) in the project directory.
Run the main script to process the data and generate insights:
bash
Copy code
$ python airbnb_analysis.py
The script will clean the data, handle missing values, and extract relevant features such as listing details, host information, pricing, and review scores.
## Tools and Libraries

This project utilizes Python programming language along with the following libraries:

1.Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

2.Matplotlib and Plotly: Data visualization.

3.JSON: Handling JSON data files.

4.NumPy: Numerical computing.

5.Streamlit: Creating interactive data applications (optional for visualization).
## Data source

The Airbnb data used in this project (sample_airbnb.json) was sourced from example.com. It includes various attributes such as property details, host information, pricing, availability, and guest reviews.
